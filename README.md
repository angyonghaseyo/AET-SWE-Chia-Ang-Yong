## Playing the Game

### 1. Load the Application
Open your web browser and go to the URL where the React application is running, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Create a Game Session
- On the homepage, click the "Create Game Session" button or similar.
- A new game session should be created, possibly redirecting you to a waiting room or game board.

### 3. Join the Game Session in Another Browser
- Open a different browser or an incognito window.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Enter a username if required and join the created game session.

### 4. Play the Game
- The game starts, and players take turns making moves.
- Continue until there's a winner or a draw.

### 5. End the Game
- The game concludes with a win or draw announcement.
- Choose to play again or end the session.

## Summary of Design/Infrastructure Decisions and Accessibility Considerations

In designing the Tic-Tac-Toe web application, a strong emphasis was placed on accessibility to ensure an inclusive and barrier-free gaming experience for all users. The decision to employ a username-based system for user identification, bypassing the complexities of a traditional authentication process, significantly lowers the entry threshold for players. This approach not only speeds up the onboarding process but also makes the game more approachable, especially for users who might find account creation and management challenging.

For the backend, MongoDB was chosen for its flexible data schema, which is particularly beneficial for storing varied user data and game states. This adaptability in data handling is essential in creating a responsive and seamless gaming experience. Coupled with Node.js and Express, this setup provides a robust infrastructure capable of handling real-time interactions, a critical aspect of multiplayer online games.

The frontend, developed with React, enhances user interaction through a responsive and dynamic interface. React's capacity to manage stateful components and efficiently update the DOM in response to user actions contributes to a smooth and accessible user experience.

A significant portion of the development effort was dedicated to implementing accessibility features. The application is designed to be compatible with screen readers, enabling visually impaired users to navigate and interact with the game effectively. Additionally, functionalities to audibly read the board and announce game states were integrated. These features not only aid users with visual impairments but also enhance the overall user experience by adding an auditory dimension to the game.

Overall, the application's design is a thoughtful blend of technology and accessibility considerations. By prioritizing user-friendliness through a simplified login process, leveraging a flexible and efficient technology stack, and incorporating key accessibility features, the Tic-Tac-Toe game stands as an inclusive and engaging platform, welcoming a diverse range of players to enjoy this classic game.
